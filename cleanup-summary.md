# 🧹 Minikube Cleanup Complete!

## What Was Cleaned Up

### ✅ **Observability Stack**
- Prometheus deployment and config
- Elasticsearch StatefulSet and data
- Kibana deployment
- Fluentd DaemonSet
- Jaeger all-in-one
- All monitoring namespace resources

### ✅ **CI/CD Stack**
- Tekton Pipelines (tasks, pipelines, runs)
- ArgoCD (applications, controllers)
- All pipeline pods and logs
- Custom Resource Definitions
- Cluster roles and bindings

### ✅ **Applications**
- Guestbook demo app
- All test pods and services
- Pipeline execution artifacts

### ✅ **Cluster Resources**
- All custom namespaces deleted
- Cluster-wide RBAC cleaned
- Webhook configurations removed
- CRDs removed

## What Remains (System Components)
```bash
✅ kube-system (Kubernetes core)
✅ kube-public (Cluster info)
✅ ingress-nginx (Ingress controller)
✅ kubernetes-dashboard (Dashboard)
✅ default namespace (clean)
```

## Cluster Status
```bash
# Clean slate ready for new projects
kubectl get namespaces
# Only system namespaces remain

kubectl get all
# Only kubernetes service in default namespace
```

## Your Learning Achievements 🏆

### **Completed Tutorials**
