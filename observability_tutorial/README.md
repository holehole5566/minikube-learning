# Kubernetes Observability Tutorial

## What is Observability?
**Observability = The ability to understand what's happening inside your system by looking at its outputs**

The **Three Pillars of Observability**:
1. **Metrics** - Numbers that tell you system performance
2. **Logs** - Text records of what happened  
3. **Traces** - Journey of requests through your system

## Tutorial Roadmap

### 01. Observability Fundamentals
- What is observability vs monitoring?
- The three pillars explained
- Kubernetes-specific observability challenges
- Tools landscape overview

### 02. Metrics with Prometheus
- Install Prometheus stack
- Understanding metrics types (counter, gauge, histogram)
- Kubernetes metrics collection
- Writing PromQL queries
- Setting up alerts

### 03. Logging with ELK/EFK Stack
- Centralized logging concepts
- Deploy Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana
- Log aggregation from pods
- Log parsing and filtering
- Creating log dashboards

### 04. Distributed Tracing with Jaeger
- Understanding distributed tracing
- Deploy Jaeger
- Instrument applications for tracing
- Analyzing request flows
- Performance bottleneck identification

### 05. Visualization with Grafana
- Install and configure Grafana
- Connect to Prometheus data source
- Build comprehensive dashboards
- Alerting and notifications
- Best practices for dashboard design

### 06. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)
- Instrument applications with metrics
- Custom metrics and business KPIs
- Health checks and SLIs/SLOs
- Error tracking and debugging

### 07. Real-World Observability Stack
- Complete observability setup
- Production-ready configurations
- Cost optimization strategies
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Observability as code

## Learning Path
```
Fundamentals → Metrics → Logs → Traces → Dashboards → APM → Production
     ↓           ↓        ↓       ↓         ↓         ↓        ↓
   Concepts → Prometheus → EFK → Jaeger → Grafana → Custom → Complete
```

## Prerequisites
- Basic Kubernetes knowledge (pods, services, deployments)
- Understanding of YAML and kubectl
- Familiarity with containerized applications
- Basic understanding of HTTP and APIs

## Tools We'll Use
- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana** - Visualization and dashboards  
- **Elasticsearch** - Log storage and search
- **Fluentd** - Log collection and forwarding
- **Kibana** - Log visualization
- **Jaeger** - Distributed tracing
- **AlertManager** - Alert routing and management

## Real-World Applications
By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Set up complete observability for production Kubernetes clusters
- Debug performance issues using metrics, logs, and traces
- Create meaningful dashboards for different stakeholders
- Implement effective alerting strategies
- Monitor application health and business metrics
- Troubleshoot distributed system problems
