# 06. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

## What is APM?

**APM = Monitoring your application's performance and business metrics from the inside**

Goes beyond infrastructure metrics to track:
- **Business KPIs**: Orders/minute, revenue, user signups
- **Application health**: Response times, error rates, throughput
- **Custom metrics**: Feature usage, A/B test results
- **SLIs/SLOs**: Service level indicators and objectives

## The Difference

### Infrastructure Monitoring
```bash
# System-level metrics
CPU: 75%
Memory: 8GB used
Disk: 20% full
Network: 100 Mbps
```

### Application Performance Monitoring  
```bash
# Business and app-level metrics
Orders created: 1,247/hour
Payment success rate: 98.5%
User login latency: 150ms avg
Feature X adoption: 23%
Revenue: $12,450/day
```

## Key APM Components

### 1. Custom Metrics
**Application-specific measurements**
```python
# Business metrics
orders_created_total.inc()
revenue_dollars.observe(99.99)
user_signups_total.labels(source='mobile').inc()

# Performance metrics  
request_duration.observe(0.245)
database_queries_total.inc()
cache_hit_ratio.set(0.85)
```

### 2. Health Checks
**Application readiness and liveness**
```python
@app.route('/health')
def health():
    return {'status': 'healthy', 'timestamp': time.time()}

@app.route('/ready')  
def ready():
    # Check dependencies
    if database_connected() and cache_available():
        return {'status': 'ready'}
    return {'status': 'not ready'}, 503
```

### 3. SLIs/SLOs
**Service Level Indicators and Objectives**
```bash
# SLI: What we measure
Availability: 99.9% uptime
Latency: 95% of requests < 200ms
Throughput: Handle 1000 req/sec
Error Rate: < 0.1% errors

# SLO: What we promise
"99.9% of API requests will complete successfully"
"95% of requests will complete in < 500ms"
```

## Learning Path
1. **Instrument applications** with custom metrics
2. **Implement health checks** for Kubernetes
3. **Define SLIs/SLOs** for your services
4. **Create business dashboards** 
5. **Set up intelligent alerting**
6. **Monitor user experience**
